# Requirements

- BepInEx 5

# Features

## Extract anywhere

The primary goal of this mod is to allow resource extractors to function fully without requiring placement atop natural resource deposits. This means that, as an example, oil drills can be placed anywhere on the map and will still produce oil for your city.

This setting can be toggled on and off for each type of resource extractor from the Extract Anywhere options menu, accessible from the main game options screen.

## Extraction radius

Allows setting the maximum area size for extraction, up to as large as 10 times, and as small as 0.1 times, the original.

This setting can be changed for each type of natural resource deposit (i.e. fertile land, forest, oil, and ore) from the Extract Anywhere options menu, accessible from the main game options screen.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Update the tooltip when drawing a resource extraction area to calculate properly when the resource is not atop its relevant natural resource deposit.
- [ ] Translation support.
